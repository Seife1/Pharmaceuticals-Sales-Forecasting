# **Rossmann Pharmaceuticals Sales Forecasting**

## **Overview**

This project focuses on building an end-to-end sales forecasting solution for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals. The objective is to predict daily sales for each store up to six weeks in advance, based on factors such as promotions, holidays, store types, and competition data. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and deep learning models, and serving the predictions through a REST API.

### **Key Objectives**:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the data, identify patterns in customer purchasing behavior, and analyze the influence of different features on sales.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement a tree-based model for predicting store sales.
- **Deep Learning**: Build an LSTM model to perform time-series forecasting.
- **Model Deployment**: Develop and deploy a REST API to serve real-time sales predictions.
